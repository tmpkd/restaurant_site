    <h4>«EXAMPLE» - a restaurant of modern Russian cuisine</h4>
    <p>The menu from our chef is distinguished by a non-classical approach to classic national dishes. A special place in it is occupied by hot dishes and desserts. The restaurant space is divided by movable partitions, which can be used to create halls of any configuration. The stained glass windows are fully sliding open, revealing a beautiful view of the city pond. The wine list is based on the specifics of the restaurant menu.</p>
